Here's a `README.md` file for your Flask and Socket.IO-based real-time location tracking project:

```markdown
# Real-Time Location Tracking

This project is a real-time location tracking web application built using Flask and Socket.IO. The application allows users to share their location with others in real-time, and updates are instantly reflected on the map.

## Features

- **Real-Time Location Sharing**: Users can share their location, which is then broadcasted to all connected users.
- **Disconnection Handling**: When a user disconnects, a notification is sent to other users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your local machine.
- `pip` (Python package installer) installed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-location-tracking.git
   cd realtime-location-tracking
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Folder Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application script.
- `templates/`: Contains the `map.html` file used as the front-end of the application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies needed for the project.
- `venv/`: Virtual environment directory (not included in the repository).

## Deployment

To deploy this application on a platform like Vercel:

1. Ensure you have a `vercel.json` file configured with the appropriate settings.
2. Push the code to your version control system (e.g., GitHub).
3. Follow the Vercel deployment guide to set up the project.

## Usage

1. **Share your location**: As soon as the user accesses the application, their location is tracked and shared with other users.
2. **Disconnect Notification**: If a user disconnects, other users will be notified.
